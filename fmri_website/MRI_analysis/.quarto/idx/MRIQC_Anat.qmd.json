[**Artifactual structures in the background**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#artifactual-structures-in-the-background)\n\n2.  [**Susceptibility distortion artifacts**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#susceptibility-distortion-artifacts)\n\n    1.  **Signal drop-out**\n    2.  **Brain distortions**\n\n3.  [**Aliasing ghost**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#aliasing-ghosts)\n\n4.  [**Wrap-around that overlaps with the brain**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#wrap-around-artifacts)\n\n5.  [**Data formatting issues**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#data-formatting-issues)\n\n-   Description is the same as the BOLD reports.\n\n-   Note that normalization and co-registration are relative robust to structural images with mild artifacts, therefore it is not always absolute necessity to impose exclusion criteria on the unprocessed T1w images.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n![](resources/flagging_T1w_common.png){#fig_s10}\n\n### Motion - related and Gibbs ringing:\n\n**Large head motion during the acquisition of T1w images often expresses itself with the appearance of concentric ripples throughout the scan**\n\n-   **Gibbs ringing:** is a consequence of the truncation of the Fourier series approximation and appears as **multiple fine lines immediately adjacent and parallel to high contrast interfaces.** But it is the same with subtle cases of motion related issues.\n\n-   **The ripples cause by motion** generally span the whole brain and are primarily visible in the **sagittal view fo MRIQC’s mosaic view**\n\n**For an example see the above image: [Figure S10E](#fig_s10)**\n\n### Intensity non-uniformity:\n\n-   **Is characterized by a smooth variation (low spatial frequency) of intensity throughout the brain caused by the strongel signal sensed in the proximity of coils.**\n\n    -   **Where:** On the zoomed-in view on the T1w image\n    -   Can be a problem for automated processing methods that assume a type of tissue \\[e.g. white matter (WM)\\] is represented by voxels of similar intensities across the whole brain.\n    -   An extreme intensity non-uniformity can also be a sign of coil failure\n\n**For an example see the above image [Figure S10F](#fig_s10)**\n\n### Eye spillover\n\n-   **Eye movements may trigger the signal leakage from the eyes through the imaging axes with the lowest bandwidth (i.e., acquired faster), potentially overlapping signal from brain tissue.**\n\n    -   A strong signal leakage can however be noticeable on the zoomed-in view of the T1w image\n    -   In defaced data the leakage might not be visible\n\n**For an example see the above image [Figure S10G](#fig_s10)**\n\n## Other Notes on Interpretation\n\nInterpretation of the visual reports of the T1w images based on [@introduc]\n\n### Zoomed-in mosaic view of the brain\n\n-   Zoomed in brain masks of the T1w images in a horzontal view\n\n    -   We want **high contrast between the grey matter and the white matter**\n\n    -   We also have to check for **ringing artifacts**\n\n### Background noise\n\n-   Yellow and green are areas with high background noise\n\n-   Dark purple are areas with lwo background noise\n\nAreas like:\n\n1.  The teeth\n\n2.  Sinus cavities\n\n3.  Air canals\n\n-   Are areas with high background noise\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](resources/BG_noise_01.png)\n\n[**But:**]{.underline} **whenever you get in the brain you don’t really want any noise, you want that all purple**\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](resources/BG_noise_02.png)\n\n**And same thing for the saggital view**\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](resources/Bg_noise_03.png)\n\n([Note:]{.underline} [After discussing with Gaëlle, the above examples are super super clean, and is not that usual to actually get so clean data, it's ok).]{.underline}\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"MRIQC_Anat.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","title":"Anatomical data","author":"Anastasios Dadiotis","editor":"visual","bibliography":["references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
