In this example, the extra 14ms of acquisition time per RF pulse is the cost of multi-echo fMRI.\n\n2.  **Weighted average may lead to an increase in SNR**\n\n    -   A weighted average of the echoes to optimize T2\\* weighting (sometimes called optimally combined) gives a reliable, modest boost in data quality.\n\n3.  **Consider the life of the dataset**\n\n    a.  If a data set is expected to be used for future analyses in later years, it is likely that more powerful approaches to multi-echo denoising will sufficiently mature and add even more value to a data set.\n\n4.  **You may recover signal in areas affected by dropout.**\n\n    -   Typical signal echo fmri uses an echo time that is appropriate for signal across most of the brain.\n\n    -   **This might lead to drop out in regions with low T2\\* values --\\> This can lead to lo or even no signal at all in some areas.**\n\n    -   **Thing of regions such as:**\n\n        -   **Orbitofrontal cortex**\n\n        -   **Ventral temporal cortex**\n\n        -   **Ventral striatum**\n\n## Multi - echo fMRI sequences\n\n-   For information about ME - fmri sequences with different scanners [see:](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi-echo.html#acquiring-multi-echo-data)\n\n## Acquisition parameter recommendations\n\nA minimumof 3 echoes is required for running the current implementation fo TE-dependent denoising in tedana. It may be useful to have at least one echo that is earlier and one echo that is later than the TE one would use for single-echo T2\\* weighted fMRI.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis is in contrast to the **dual echo** denoising method which uses a very early (\\~5ms) first echo in order to clean data.\n\n## Tedana combination method\n\nUsing the T2\\*estimates, tedana combines signal across echoes using a weighted average. The echoes are weighted according to the formula\n\n![](resources/tedana_formula.png)\n\nThe weights are then normalized across echoes. These normalized weights are then used to compute a weighted average that takes advantage of the higher signal in earlier echoes and the higher sensitivity at later echoes.\n\n \n\n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"multi_echo.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","title":"Multi - Echo","editor":"visual"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
