The idea is to **plot voxel time series in close spatial proximity so that the eye notes temporal coincidence.**\n\nBoth in MRIQC and FMRIPrep\n\n**Crown area:** correspond’s to voxels located on a closed band around the brain’s outer edge. As those voxels are outside the brain, we do not expect any signal there, meaning that if some signal is observed, we can interpret it as artifactual.\n\n**A strongly structured crown region in the carpet plot is a sign that the artifacts are compromising the fmri scanner.** Could be due to: 1. Motions peaks 2. Periodic motion (e.g. respiration) 3. Coil failure 4. Drift of unknown origin\n\n**Finding temporal patterns similar in gray matter areas and simultaneously in regions of no interest (for instance, cerebrospinal fluid or the crown) indicates the presence of artifacts, typically derived from head motion.**\n\nIf the planned analysis specifies noise regression techniques based on information from these regions of no interest \\[which is standard and recommended (Ciric et al., 2017)\\], the risk of removing signals with neural origins is high, and affected scans should be excluded.\n\n**What to look for:** ![](resources/Carpet_mriqc.png)\n\n### Hyperintensity of single slices\n\nSeveral time series to support the interpretation of the carpet plot. **The slice-wise z-standardized signal average is useful for detecting sudden “spikes” in the average intensity of single slices of BOLD scans.**\n\n-   When paired with the motion traces, it is possible to determine whether these spikes are caused by:\n\n    -   **Motion** --\\> Spikes caused by motion typically [**affect several or all slices**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\n    -   Or by possible **problems with the scanner** (e.g. white-pixel noise) --\\> Spikes caused by **white - pixel noise affect [only one]{style=\"color:red;\"} slice and are generally more acute**\n\n    -   White-pixel noise is generally caused by some small pieces of metal in the scan room or a loose screw on the scanner that accumulates energy and then discharges randomly.In the image domain, it manifests as an abrupt signal intensity change in one slice at one time point.\n\n    -   **For resting-state data, you discard BOLD scans containing these spikes regardless of their physical origin (motion vs. white-pixel noise) because correlation analyses are likely biased by such peaks. Task data analyses are typically more robust to this particular artifact.**\n\n**What to look for:**\n\n![](resources/Hyperintensity.png)\n\n### Vertical strikes in the sagittal plane of the standard deviation map\n\n-   The sagittal view of the sd map might show vertical strike patterns that extend hyperintensities through the whole sagittal plan\n\n-   Exclude all images that showcase these patterns\n\n**What to look for:**\n\n![](resources/vertical_Strikes.png)\n\n### Data formatting issues\n\n-   Such mistakes result in the brain image not being correctly visualized and preprocessed, with axes either being flipped (e.g. the anterior part of the brain is labeled as posterior) or switched (e.g. axial slices are interpreted as coronal ones).\n\n**What to look for:**\n\n![](resources/Data_formatting_issues.png)\n\n## Other Notes on Interpretation\n\nFollowing notes are mainly from [@introduc].\n\n### Bold average\n\nIt gives you the Bold average, so it’s averaging all the volumes together and presenting them as this slices through that average.\n\n-   **-** What are you looking for is in the main area of the brain to see a high contrast between grey and white matter\\*\\*\\\n    **BUT: Note that these images are not preprossessed so there is no distortion correction! So in an AP image as the one below if you see some smooshing at the front and some extension at the back that’s completely normal**\n\n**Example:** (AP image)\n\n![Bold average](resources/bold_average_MRIQC.png)\n\n### Standard deviation map\n\n\\*\\* It is the spread of the value of all the voxels over the entire time course\\*\\*\n\ne.g. : When you are looking to at the sd of voxels that correspond to the eyes, these have high sd because the are constantly moving so the values are going to have a high spread.\n\n![](resources/sd_map_MRIQC_01.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   **But when you are in the brain what you want are low sd values!**\n\n-   Also, you get areas of high sd:\n\n    -   along the edges of the brain (due to slight movement that causes these voxels to have brain or CSF or skull or empty space)  \n\n    -   and in some of the major blood vessels that go through the brain  \n\n![](resources/sd_map_MRIGC_02.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Framewise Displacement (FD) \\[mm\\]\n\nThe absolute distance after motion that the brain moved from the beginning reference image (but note that no actual motion correction is saved at this point).\n\n-   **0.2 mm cut -off,** you get an idea on how many volumes when beyond this cut-off point, **note** that this is a pretty stringent cut-off score for FD\n\n**Example:**\n\n![](resources/FD_MRIQC.png)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"MRIQC_BOLD.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"cosmo","title":"BOLD data","editor":"visual","bibliography":["references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
